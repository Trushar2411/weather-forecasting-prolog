## 🌟 Introduction  
Modern weather forecasting systems often rely on **black-box models**, which are challenging to interpret.  
This project addresses this gap by building a weather prediction system using **Prolog**,  
a logic-based programming language that ensures **transparent reasoning and explainability**.  

🔍 **Focus**: Predict key weather attributes like:  
- **🌡️ Temperature**  
- **☀️ Solar Radiation**  

📍 **Currently Supported Location**: Düsseldorf, Germany  
🌍 **Future Expansion**: Extendable to other cities and parameters.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset is sourced from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)** and includes the following attributes:  
- 🌡️ **Temperature (°C)**  
- ☀️ **Solar Radiation (kW/m²)**  
- 💧 **Humidity (%)**  
- 🌬️ **Wind Speed (m/s)**  
- 📅 **Date and Time**  

📌 The dataset was cleaned, normalized, and structured to suit Prolog-based modeling.

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
🎯 Build a **transparent and explainable weather forecasting system**.  
🎯 Utilize **Prolog** for reasoning and decision-making.  
🎯 Create a **scalable framework** for adding new cities and weather parameters.  
🎯 Ensure **interpretability and accuracy** in predictions.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details  
1. **📊 Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Cleaned and normalized the dataset.  
   - Converted data into Prolog-compatible facts and rules.  

2. **💻 Prolog-Based Prediction Model**:  
   - Developed logic-based rules for temperature and solar radiation predictions.  
   - Encoded historical weather trends into a Prolog knowledge base.  

3. **🤖 Explainability**:  
   - Prolog inherently provides logical reasoning for each prediction.  

4. **👤 User Interaction**:  
   - Users can query Prolog for weather predictions based on location and date.
